## Overview
Complete redesign of the Learning Materials feature with iOS-inspired aesthetic, improved like/unlike functionality, and optimized search performance.

## What Changed

### üé® UI/UX Improvements

#### 1. **MaterialsList Cards** - Complete iOS-Style Redesign
- **Rounded corners**: Cards now use `rounded-[2rem]` for a softer, iOS-like appearance
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Subtle gradient from white to slate with hover effects
- **Shadow animations**: Cards elevate on hover with smooth transitions
- **Enhanced metadata display**:
  - ‚úÖ **Filename** with file icon
  - ‚úÖ **Author name/email** with user icon
  - ‚úÖ **Description** (line-clamped to 2 lines)
  - ‚úÖ **Public/Private badge** with gradient backgrounds (emerald for public, amber for private)
  - ‚úÖ **Tags** (showing first 3, with +N indicator)
  - ‚úÖ **Upload date** with calendar icon
  - ‚úÖ **File size** with storage icon
  - ‚úÖ **Likes count** with heart icon
  - ‚úÖ **Downloads count** with download icon
- **Action buttons**:
  - Preview (border style)
  - Download (blue gradient)
  - Like/Unlike (rose gradient when liked, border when not)
  - Quiz (purple gradient)
  - Delete (conditional, red border)

#### 2. **SearchAndFilterBar** - Enhanced Header
- Animated badge with pulsing dot
- Gradient text for heading
- Rounded search input with focus rings
- Improved button styling with shadows and hover effects
- Better placeholder text

#### 3. **SectionFilters** - Grid Layout with Gradients
- Changed from flex to grid layout (responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)
- Active filters show gradient backgrounds matching their theme
- Icon badges with subtle background
- Smooth scale animation on hover for active filters
- Enhanced focus states with ring effects

#### 4. **UploadDrawer** - Modern Modal Design
- Increased z-index to z-50 for proper layering
- Gradient background overlay
- Improved file upload area with gradient hover effect
- Enhanced form inputs with focus rings
- Better button spacing and styling
- File icon in upload zone

### ‚ö° Functionality Enhancements

#### 1. **Like/Unlike System**
**Frontend:**
- Added `user_liked` boolean to `LearningMaterial` type
- Created `unlikeLearningMaterial` API function
- Updated dashboard to toggle between like/unlike
- Visual feedback: heart fills and button changes to gradient when liked

**Backend:**
- Created `material_likes` junction table with RLS policies
- Added `unlike` method to `LearningMaterialsController`
- Updated `like` method to prevent duplicate likes
- Modified `index` and `show` methods to include `user_liked` status
- Database triggers automatically sync `likes_count` on insert/delete

**Migration:**
- `20241029_create_material_likes_table.sql` - Run this on Supabase to create the table

#### 2. **Debounced Search**
- Created custom `useDebounce` hook (400ms delay)
- Search now waits for user to stop typing before making API call
- Reduces server load and improves performance
- Maintains responsive UI with instant typing feedback

#### 3. **Enhanced Type Safety**
- Added `uploader_email` to `LearningMaterial` type
- Added `user_liked` boolean field
- Updated query hook to include email in normalization

## Database Migration Required

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Run the following migration on your Supabase project:

```sql
-- File: php-backend/migrations/20241029_create_material_likes_table.sql
```

This creates:
- `material_likes` table with proper foreign keys
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies for security
- Triggers to auto-sync `likes_count`

## Files Modified

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/types.ts` - Added `user_liked` and `uploader_email`
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/api.ts` - Added `unlikeLearningMaterial`
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/hooks/useDebounce.ts` - New custom hook
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/useLearningMaterialsQuery.ts` - Added `uploader_email` and `user_liked` handling
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/LearningMaterialsDashboard.tsx` - Debounced search, like/unlike handler
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/components/MaterialsList.tsx` - Complete redesign
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/components/SearchAndFilterBar.tsx` - iOS styling
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/components/SectionFilters.tsx` - Grid layout + animations
- `studystreak/src/Features/LearningMaterials/components/UploadDrawer.tsx` - Modal improvements

### Backend (PHP)
- `php-backend/public/index.php` - Added `/unlike` route
- `php-backend/src/Controllers/LearningMaterialsController.php`:
  - Added `unlike()` method
  - Updated `like()` to check for existing likes
  - Modified `index()` to fetch and include `user_liked` status
  - Modified `show()` to include `user_liked` status
  - Updated `transformMaterial()` to preserve `user_liked`

### Database
- `php-backend/migrations/20241029_create_material_likes_table.sql` - New migration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration on Supabase
- [ ] Test like button - should add like and update count
- [ ] Test unlike button - should remove like and decrement count
- [ ] Test like persistence - reload page, like status should remain
- [ ] Test search debouncing - type quickly, should only search after pause
- [ ] Verify all metadata displays correctly (filename, author, etc.)
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Verify public/private badges show correct colors
- [ ] Test dark mode appearance
- [ ] Verify hover animations and transitions

## Design Highlights

### Color Palette
- **Blue gradients**: Primary actions (download, upload)
- **Rose/Pink gradients**: Like button (when active)
- **Purple gradients**: Quiz button
- **Emerald/Teal gradients**: Public materials, refresh button
- **Amber/Orange gradients**: Private materials
- **Slate tones**: Neutral UI elements

### Animation Effects
- `hover:-translate-y-1` - Card lift on hover
- `transition-all duration-300` - Smooth transitions
- `shadow-xl` on hover - Enhanced depth
- `scale-[1.02]` - Subtle scale for active filters
- `animate-pulse` - Badge indicator

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels on all buttons
- Focus-visible ring states
- Semantic HTML structure
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support

## Future Enhancements

1. **Quiz Generation** - Connect Quiz button to AI service
2. **Material Preview** - Enhance preview modal with better PDF viewer
3. **Bulk Actions** - Improve bulk delete with confirmation modal
4. **Sorting** - Add more sort options (most viewed, recently updated)
5. **Filtering** - Add category/tag-based filtering
6. **Analytics** - Track views, downloads per material

## Notes

- Old `MaterialsList.tsx` backed up to `MaterialsList.old.tsx`
- Like system uses optimistic updates for instant feedback
- Debounce hook can be reused for other search inputs
- All gradients use Tailwind's built-in utilities
- Dark mode fully supported via Tailwind dark: variants
