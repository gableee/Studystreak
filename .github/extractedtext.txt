ML is a part of AI that enables computers to self-learn from information and apply that learning without human intercession. Under the umbrella of supervised learning fall: Classification, Regression and Forecasting. The Naïve Bayes classifier is based on Bayes’ theorem and classifies every value as independent of any other value. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is used to categorize unlabeled data, i. e. data without defined categories or groups. The Support Vector Machine algorithms are supervised learning models that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. An artificial neural network (ANN) comprises ‘units’ arranged in a series of layers, each of which connects to layers on either side. ANNs are inspired by biological systems, such as the brain, and how they process information. Apriori algorithm is used in a transactional database to mine frequent item sets. Neural Network applications can be classified the in the following domains: - Images - Signals - Language. fields like image classification or labelling, or the signal detection or translation of languages like Google Translator, spoof detection using some biometric or signal or some kind of forecasting or prediction. Deep learning powers product and content recommendations for Amazon and Netflix. It works in the background of Google’s voice-and image-recognition algorithms. In artificial intelligence, expert systems are the computer programs that rely on obtaining knowledge of human knowledge. This presentation uses a free template provided by FPPT. Virtual Assistants / Chat Bots - Chatbots are the bots designed for a specific use of interaction with humans or other fellow machines using the techniques of AI. The use of Chatbots goes way back to 1966 when the first chatterbot named “ELIZA” was designed at MIT.\n\n## 📌 Key Concepts\n- **Subsets of AI Lecture 7:** 📖 Marissa B.\n- **The operator provides the machine:** 💡 learning algorithm with a known dataset that includes desired inputs and outputs, and the algorithm must find a method to determine how to arrive at those inputs and outputs.\n- **Regression: In regression tasks, the machine learning program must estimate:** 🔍 and understand - the relationships among variables.\n- **In an unsupervised learning process,:** ⚡ the algorithm is left to interpret large data sets and address that data accordingly.\n- **Dimension reduction:** 🎓 Dimension reduction reduces the number of variables being considered to find the exact information required.\n- **It allows us to predict:** 📌 a class/category, based on a given set of features, using probability.\n- **For example, in spam, you:** ✨ can see the word ‘vaccine’ much more often than in regular mail.\n- **Image classification.:** 🧠 \n- **It then works iteratively to:** 📚 assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features provided.\n- **They essentially filter data into:** 🔬 categories, which is achieved by providing a set of training examples, each set marked as belonging to one or the other of the two categories.\n- **ANNs are essentially a large:** 📖 number of interconnected processing elements, working in unison to solve specific problems.\n- **If the person is over:** 💡 30 years and is not married, we walk the tree as follows ‘over 30 years.\n  - 💡 Use: ’ -> yes -> ’married ’ -> no.\n- **Can predict the likelihood that the passengers in Titanic would have survived based on their characteristics:** 🔍 Nearest Neighbors (Supervised LearningClassification/Regression) The K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm estimates how likely a data point is to be a member of one group or another.\n- **This could be written in the form of an association rule as:** ⚡ {milk, sugar} -> coffee powder.\n- **Neural Network applications can be classified the in the following domains:** 🎓 \n• Images\n• Signals\n• Language This presentation uses a free template provided by FPPT.\n  - 💡 Use: com www free-power-point-templates com Neural Networks 1.\n- **Here the scanned images of:** 📌 documents are fed to the model, and the model recognizes the textual information in that scanned document.\n- **Image Generation:** ✨ The image generations helps in generating fake images based on the data.\n- **ANN in Language:** 🧠 This can be divided into two models: - Text Classification and Categorization: Text classification is an essential part of document search and filtering, online web searches and language identification and sentiment analysis.\n- **The only difference in deep:** 📚 learning model is that with experience, the model becomes better without any specific guidance.\n- **This presentation uses a free template provided by FPPT. com www. free-power-point-templates. com Deep Learning:** 🔬 Deep learning utilizes alleged neural systems, which “learn from processing the labeled information provided during training and uses this answer key to realize what attributes of the information are expected to build the right yield,” as per one clarification given…\n- **Robots are deployed regularly for:** 📖 directing tasks that may be difficult for people to perform consistently.\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) can:** 💡 be treated as a subfield of linguistics concerned with the interaction between computer machine and human.\n- **Statistical NLP is better because:** 🔍 humans do not stick to grammar rules in general communication, and also a way of speaking also differs from person to person.\n- **Sentiment Analysis, based on Stanford:** ⚡ NLP, can be used to identify the feeling, opinion, or belief of a statement, from very negative, to neutral, to very positive.",
